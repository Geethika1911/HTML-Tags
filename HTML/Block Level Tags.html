        <p style="color:palevioletred">Holi,the vibrant festival of colors, celebrates the arrival of spring and the
            triumph of good over evil. Observed in India and Nepal, Holi begins with Holika Dahan, a bonfire symbolizing the burning of evil spirits.
             The next day, people play with colors, splashing and smearing each other with powders and waters. Holi is a time for
            merriment, forgiveness, and renewal, strengthening bonds and creating memories. With its infectious energy
            and kaleidoscope of colors, Holi embodies joy, love, and unity</p>
            <pre style="color:orange"> As the colors blend and merge,Holi becomes a celebration 
                of unity and diversity.People from all walks of life come together, forgetting their differences. 
                The festival's vibrant colors and infectious energy create a sense of joy and abandon, allowing people
                 to let loose and revel in the moment. Holi's magic lingers long after the colors fade.</pre>
